If you're an Outsystems developer in a professional environment, you will probably collaborate with other developers. Usually you will be working on developing a single feature or user story per developer. Since Outsystems has a single \"branch\", you are basically blocked for deployment if you're colleagues are still working on user stories.\n\n#### How does the versioning work?\n\nOutsystems uses a [trunk mechanism based](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) development system. Environments are leveraged to run other versions. Those versions should be increasingly stable, ranking from development (least stable) to production (most stable). When you publish a module in Development, Outsystems proprietary mechanism stores a version of that module. When someone else publishes a newer version in the meantime, your version is automatically merged when published. At least, when there's no merge conflict. In that case you will have to choose pick and choose which version of the conflict to keep. In order to deploy your application, you will have to [\"tag\" your application with a version in Lifetime](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/developing_an_application/design_ui/patterns/using_traditional_web_patterns/content/tag/). That version can then be deployed to one of your environments.\n\n![trunk based development.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqwogyxqp/image/upload/v1702504460/trunk_based_development_e9b739721d.png)\n\nThe platform does offer the option to publish your changes in a [Personal area](https://success.outsystems.com/documentation/11/developing_an_application/troubleshooting_applications/debugging_applications/public_and_personal_areas/). That allows you to test and debug your changes without affecting other modules on the server. This feature however, is only supported in certain cases, for example when you haven't changed any entities, timers or site properties. So it's not a real alternative to branching I would say.\n\nA few years back, in 2020, Outsystems main competitor Mendix [added support for Git](https://devops.com/mendix-adds-git-repository-support-to-low-code-platform/) as version control system. Actually I'm a bit jealous and hope Outsystems will catch up.\n\n#### Why does Outsystems not support branches?\n\nActually, I can only guess. There may be a few reasons.
