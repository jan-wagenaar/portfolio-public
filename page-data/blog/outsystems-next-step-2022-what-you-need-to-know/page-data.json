However, the details remained scarce. This year Outsystems finally shared more. First of all, Project Neo will now be called [Outsystems Developer Cloud (ODC)](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platform/developer-cloud/). It will be build on an AWS cloud infrastructure. Apps will run in their own container, which is based on Kubernetes. This enables scalability. If demand increases, Kubernetes is able to spin up new instances. It makes it also faster for instances to deployed. It’s hard to draw conclusions from the demo’s on NextStep, but deployments seemed faster. One-Click Publish however seemed to take longer. But then again, Outsystems may still be optimizing this part. Containerisation also helps to improve the security. It helps to isolate parts of the infrastructure, as apps run in their own sandbox.\n\n### ODC – familiar, but different\nThe new ODC takes most of the concepts of Outsystems 11. Outsystems showed the new IDE, ODC Portal, which looked very familiar. As they stated, Outsystems wanted to make it easy for developers to make the jump. But there is something to look forward to. Outsystems added functionality from Service Center. For example deployments, monitoring and user access management can now be done from the ODC Portal.\n\n### Improved AI \nLike last year, Outsystems is improving its AI which helps building and validating apps. Formerly known as Architecture dashboard, it will now be called by the [AI Mentor Systems](https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platform/architecture-dashboard/). As we’ve seen in the last year, Outsystems is including more and more types of validation in this tool. It makes sense to change it’s name since the scope is much larger now. \n\n### More platform extensibility\nFollowing on the trend of more platform extensibility, Outsystems will now be exposing monitoring and logs through the [OpenTelemetry API](https://opentelemetry.io/). This enables the use of third-party monitoring tools such as [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), and [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/). Besides logging, Outsystems promises that ODC will be API-first. That will enabling customers and suppliers to build tools that will enhance productivity.
