Legacy systems are preventing it from scaling up its business. Changes necessary to attract new drivers and customers take months to implement. This means astronomical costs in both maintenance and development. For example, of every dollar paid for a parcel, $0.28 of it was spent on IT infrastructure. One example why DPS needs to spend so much, is due the use of COBOL in most of its core systems. The consultants to develop these systems, if available at all, charge excessive amounts. This is threatening for DPS revenue. Last year DPS lost 1.19 million in profit. Shareholders are warning this year will be the same, if no immediate actions are undertaken. In short, DPSâ€™ core systems needs to change, and they need to change fast.\n\nRecently, DPS came into contact with Outsystems. They have asked you to create a [MVP](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/) for some their core systems. In short they want to receive request to send parcels from business customers, track and update parcels throughout their journey and expose that to their customers.\n\nAs the board is a bit sceptical about Outsystems capabilities, itâ€™s your job to convince them. Since DPS is a multinational, architecture is important. Before jumping into development, take a step back and consider all the parts required. Read all the stories, map them to larger concepts and consider how they impact each other. This ensures that DPS is able to grow as promised.\n\nDPS is mainly focused on delivery parcels, since the rise of e-commerce. Weâ€™ll be building application to support this process. In short this process looks like this:\n\n![Parcel delivery process of DPS](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqwogyxqp/image/upload/v1679520186/Shipment_process_description_e4cdb55584.png)\n \n #### User stories\nEach part of this process will be described in one or multiple stories.\nDPS requires high performance applications. Each day, DPS delivers roughly 560.000 parcels to their customers. All these packages needs to be registered, tracked and planned properly. Both logic and interfaces need to be efficient. Fault tolerance is also a topic to consider. Not every parcels journey is completed the first try. Packages might get lost, are send to incorrect addresses or exceed weight limits. Log errors, implement business checks and provide ways for employees to resolve errors.\n\nGood luck and have fun while completing this challenge!\n  \n  \n#### Story #1: Request shipments\n  \n##### Description\nAs an business to business customer I would like to request shipments using my own e-commerce package through an integration. In this request I will provide an origin and destination address, addressee, packet size and weight. After submitting the request, a shipment is generated. I can retrieve this shipment, and other shipments, via a second integration endpoint. \n\nFor each shipment an unique code is generated, which follows the following pattern: DPS028523112862212. This code will be used later to identify the package.\n\nTo request shipments in a secure matter, we need to verify shipment requests using a client id and token. After validation, a shipment request may be registered. If validation fails, the request is simply discarded. A list of valid credentials is provided below.\n\nShipment addresses will need to be created, if not available.\n\nSince DPS receives thousands of these requests, possibly simultaneously, we need to guarantee handling of the requests. This means we need to implement scalability right into our infrastructure. \n\nTo simulate the package requests, we created small mock application. We included the application package below. Run the timer in RequestGenerator_CS to generate shipment requests.\n\n##### Criteria\n- Requests are processed real-time\n- Requests can only be made authenticated\n- Unique shipment code is created per shipment\n- Invalid requests are moved to an error queue, including an error message\n- Able to retrieve a list of shipments including details"}},"SEO":{"keywords":"code challenge, micro services, learn, user stories, development, postal company, backend, senior developer, advanced challenge","metaDescription":"In the coming weeks we will build a series of microservices for a postal company.","metaTitle":"Postal Services code challenge #1 - Getting started"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b1d09948-4c96-517c-9d19-90cd997e0037","slug":"code-challenge-postal-services-1","__params":{"slug":"code-challenge-postal-services-1"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1172744636","139564425","2159283857","3769587215","4020630752","584364458"],"slicesMap":{}}
