In most cases this means a major improvement in the perceived performance.\\nLet\\u2019s consider a list with a delete function. When a user clicks the trash button in Traditional Web, the server is notified and executes the action related to it. After that the list is rebuild and rendered. Then the rendered html is sent to the user, and the page updated through an AJAX refresh. As you can see, every action needs a round trip to the server. Reactive is different. Since the HTML is rendered by the client, it\\u2019s able to update the page while the request is sent to the server.
